<p> During the pandemic, I started to work from home. I didn't do much because of it but after a few months I would go to I-Drive and just walk around. It was empty for the most part but I enjoyed it.</p>

<h1> Three things I like</h1>
<ul>
<li> Golf</li>
<li> Taking walks at the park</li>
<li> Quality time with my family</li>
</ul>
